### This repository is created to generate awareness of my other repository in Search Engines 
# Apache Log Parser and Data Normalization Application
[ApacheLogs2MySQL](https://github.com/willthefarmer/ApacheLogs2MySQL) consists of two Python Modules & one MySQL Schema to automate importing Access & Error files and normalizing data into database designed for reports & data analysis.

Automates consolidation of logs from multiple Servers and unlimited Domains with audit trail & error logging.
## Python handles File Processing & MySQL handles Data Processing

The repository is barely found in [GitHub search](https://github.com/search) regardless of Topics added to Repository. Repositories inactive 5 and 10 years with NO Forks and NO Stars come up before mine. Even single file repositories with NO repository Topics are ranked higher than mine. 

When repository is finally listed several pages in the Social Preview Image is not displayed. The Image did display 3 weeks ago but no longer does. The search functionality is quite disappointing...

Maybe it's due to the majority of my repository being developed in SQL langauge. Anyone with insight of how I might remedy my repository's poor search rankings I would appreciate your input on this matter.
