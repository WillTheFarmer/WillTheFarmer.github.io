# Apache Log Parser and Data Normalization Website
[ApacheLogs2MySQL](https://github.com/willthefarmer/apache-logs-to-mysql) consists of two Python Modules & one MySQL Schema that parse and import Access & Error log files and normalizes data into database designed for reports & data analysis.

This application automates consolidation of log files from multiple Servers and unlimited Domains with audit trail & error logging.
## Python handles File Processing & MySQL handles Data Processing

The ApacheLogs2MySQL repository is barely found in [GitHub search](https://github.com/search) regardless of Topics added to Repository.

None of the Search Engines outside of GitHub have yet to find the ApacheLogs2MySQL repository.

My conclusions is the poor search results are:

- Due to repository name which is renamed from ApacheLogs2MySQL to apache-logs-to-mysql on 1/9/2025.

or 

- Due to a large majority of repository codebase is SQL language.

GitHub does not even recognize SQL as a language. I had to add code to `.gitattributes` to have it appear on repository.
```
*.sql linguist-detectable=true
*.sql linguist-language=sql
```
SQL is much more important and powerful language in real-world applications than many langauges detected by GitHub.

Hopefully creating this repository, website and image :point_down: improves apache-logs-to-mysql repository visibility.
