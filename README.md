### This repository is created in attempt to generate awareness of my other repository in Search Engines 
# Apache Log Parser and Data Normalization Application
[ApacheLogs2MySQL](https://github.com/willthefarmer/ApacheLogs2MySQL) consists of two Python Modules & one MySQL Schema to automate importing Access & Error files and normalizing data into database designed for reports & data analysis.
## Python handles File Processing & MySQL handles Data Processing

The repository is barely found in [GitHub search](https://github.com/search) regardless of the Topics added to repository. Repositories inactive 5 and 10 years come up before mine. Single file repositories with NO repository Topics are ranked pages higher than mine. 

When it is finally listed 10 pages in the Social preview is not displayed. It did display 3 weeks ago but no longer does. The search functionality is quite disappointing... 

Maybe it's due to the majority of my repository being developed in SQL langauge. Anyone with insight of how I might remedy my repository's poor search rankings I would appreciate your input on this matter.
