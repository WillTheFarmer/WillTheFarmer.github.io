Current purpose of this repository is to promote newly named `apache-logs-to-mysql` repository and in development `mysql-to-apache-echarts` repository on search engines by implementing Search Engine Optimization (SEO). 

The 4 month old `ApacheLogs2MySQL` repository had barely been found in [GitHub search](https://github.com/search) regardless of Topics added to Repository.

No search engines outside of GitHub had yet to list the `ApacheLogs2MySQL` repository.

After researching the subject my deduction for poor search results is one or both of the following:

- Repository name - Renamed from ApacheLogs2MySQL to apache-logs-to-mysql on 1/9/2025.

or 

- SQL - A large majority of repository codebase is SQL language.

GitHub does not recognize SQL as a language and requires adding code to `.gitattributes` for SQL to appear on repository. 
```
*.sql linguist-detectable=true
*.sql linguist-language=sql
```
# Apache Log Parser and Data Normalization Application
[ApacheLogs2MySQL](https://github.com/willthefarmer/apache-logs-to-mysql) consists of two Python Modules & one MySQL Schema that parse and import Access & Error log files and normalizes data into database designed for reports & data analysis.

This application automates consolidation of log files from multiple Servers and unlimited Domains with audit trail & error logging.
## Python handles File Processing & MySQL handles Data Processing

# Apache Log Management and Visualization Application
[MySQL2ApacheECharts](https://github.com/willthefarmer/mysql-to-apache-echarts) consists of Express.js web application frameworks with Drill Down Capability & Apache ECharts framework for rapid construction of Log Data Visualization for reports & data analysis
from MySQL Schema ***apache_logs*** created by [ApacheLogs2MySQL](https://github.com/willthefarmer/apache-logs-to-mysql).

## Express handles Data Querying & ECharts handles Data Visualization of MySQL Schema

Hopefully repository rename and creating this repository, website and images :point_down: improves `apache-logs-to-mysql` repository visibility and `mysql-to-apache-echarts` repository awareness.
