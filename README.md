# Apache Log Parser and Data Normalization Website
[ApacheLogs2MySQL](https://github.com/willthefarmer/ApacheLogs2MySQL) consists of two Python Modules & one MySQL Schema that parse and import Access & Error log files and normalizes data into database designed for reports & data analysis.

This application automates consolidation of log files from multiple Servers and unlimited Domains with audit trail & error logging.
## Python handles File Processing & MySQL handles Data Processing

The ApacheLogs2MySQL repository is barely found in [GitHub search](https://github.com/search) regardless of Topics added to Repository.

None of the Search Engines outside of GitHub have yet to find the ApacheLogs2MySQL repository.

Hopefully this repository and website improves ApacheLogs2MySQL repository visibility.

My only conclusion is the poor search results are due to a large majority of repository codebase is SQL language.

GitHub does not even recognize SQL as a language. I had to add code to `.gitattributes` to have it appear on repository.
```
*.sql linguist-detectable=true
*.sql linguist-language=sql
```
SQL is a way more important and powerful language in real-world applications than many langauges detected by GitHub.
