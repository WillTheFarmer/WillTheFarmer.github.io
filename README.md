# Apache Log Parser and Data Normalization Website
[ApacheLogs2MySQL](https://github.com/willthefarmer/apache-logs-to-mysql) consists of two Python Modules & one MySQL Schema that parse and import Access & Error log files and normalizes data into database designed for reports & data analysis.

This application automates consolidation of log files from multiple Servers and unlimited Domains with audit trail & error logging.
## Python handles File Processing & MySQL handles Data Processing

The ApacheLogs2MySQL repository is barely found in [GitHub search](https://github.com/search) regardless of Topics added to Repository.

No search engines outside of GitHub have yet to find the ApacheLogs2MySQL repository.

My conclusion for the poor search results is one or both of the following:

- Repository name - Renamed from ApacheLogs2MySQL to apache-logs-to-mysql on 1/9/2025.

or 

- SQL - A large majority of repository codebase is SQL language.

GitHub does not recognize SQL as a language. I had to add code to `.gitattributes` for SQL to appear on repository. 
```
*.sql linguist-detectable=true
*.sql linguist-language=sql
```
GiHub's prejudice against SQL is surprising and leads me to qustion if this is reason for poor GitHub search results.

In real-world applications SQL is much more important and powerful language than many langauges detected by GitHub. 

Hopefully creating this repository, website and image :point_down: improves apache-logs-to-mysql repository visibility.
